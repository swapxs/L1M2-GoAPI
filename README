ABOUT THIS PROJECT:
----
Tools Used:
    Language: Go
    Libraries: Go-Gin, Go-SQLite

Working:
    This is an Task Management API Project that does the following functions:
        1. Listens to port 8080 for HTTP requests using Gin's router feature
        2. Checks the type of HTTP requests and acts according to the request
           type
        3. For GET /tasks, it lists all the tasks in the SQLite database
        4. For GET /tasks/{id}, it lists the tasks with that id.
        5. For POST /tasks, it creates a new task.
        6. For PUT /tasks/{id}, it updates the task with the specific id.
        7. For DELETE /tasks/{id}, it deletes the task with the id.

Outcome and overview:
    The program runs using the `go run main.go` command and can be buildable
    using the `go build .` command, which will create an executable that can be
    natively executed with good performance. Once built, it can be coppied to
    the system's bin directory or any other path for native execution meaning
    execution with mentioning a path to the executable.

    For testing the API we have used POSTMAN with the GET, POST, PUT and DELETE
    HTTP requests and have set our `http://localhost:8080` as our base url.

    But this can also be done using the `curl` command available in most
    Operating Systems.
